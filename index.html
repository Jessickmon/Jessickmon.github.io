                        Howdy! My name is Jesse "Phillip" Tran, 
                        and I am in the class of 2025, majoring in Computer
                        Science and Mathematics with an increasing appeal 
                        to Philosophy.

                    <p class="about_me_information">
                        From developing web and mobile applications to 
                        building computers and mechanical keyboards to constructing
                        machine learning models, I love surrounding myself with 
                        anything involving computers. Since I built my first computer
                        at the age of thirteen, my child-like curiosity for them 
                        stuck and grew with me. Now, equipped with a couple years of 
                        experience in machine learning research and a blooming interest
                        in full-stack development, I strive to explore opportunities 
                        in both industry and academia.
